export const aboutUsText = `Our team put a lot of effort into building this final project, working together in a coordinated and thoughtful way. Each team member made a significant contribution, taking ownership of key parts of the application and actively participating in the collaborative development process.

Mikhail laid the technical foundation of the project from the start: he set up the repository, organized the task board, and ensured a solid structure for our teamwork. He developed the registration page and user profile page, and also worked on the cart page together with Meru. In addition to his development work, Mikhail shared his experience through code reviews — his feedback and suggestions helped improve code quality and deepen our understanding of the implementation. Meru focused on key user-facing pages — she implemented the login page and the product catalog. Together with Mikhail, she also contributed to the development of the cart page, ensuring both its functionality and consistency with the rest of the UI. Kate worked on the overall interface and layout. She created the header and footer, the main page, the detailed product page, and the “About Us” page. Her contribution brought coherence, accessibility, and a polished visual style to the application.

Each of us not only worked on specific components but also actively participated in discussions, testing, and refinement. As a result, we were able to deliver a cohesive, functional, and well-crafted web product.`
